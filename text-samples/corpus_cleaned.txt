 Who cares about the belch thing you guys are talking about The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling Let's do this thing  Alright listen you two we froze time for a pretty long time so when I unfreeze it the world's time is gonna be fine but our time's gonna need a little time to you know stabilize  It means relax and stop being a pussy Morty I thought you learned that by now It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards  And away we go  Shhh Morty  Negative visualization Jerry It explains a lot about where you're at Hi sweety  Yeah it would literally destroy them Now listen why do—why do—why—why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream go out there and get some ice creams Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh kick it on over to ya You guys go nuts  Uh oh  Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on Oh you agree huh Summer: Funny You like that Red Grin Grumble reference Summer: Yeah Well guess what I made him up You really are your father's children Think for yourselves don't be sheep  Yup it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be One minute you're falling off a roof for six months the next minute bam  Actually sorry Summer I gotta back the M bomb on this one I remember the conversation We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies your job was to put the mattress under Mr Benson  Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell  Oh God oh no what did you guys just do  belch Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now  Alright both of you just don't move don't speak don't think I have to check something  Shut up Oh crap are you kidding me Two dots This never needs to be more than one dot The two of you made us uncertain  Our time is fractured You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker We're entirely hypothetical  We're not on any timeline dummy Look  I assume they're Schrodinger's cats A-actually I assume they both are and aren't just like us  “Mom and Dad ” Get your head out of your family's ass The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion Your parents get to exist They're probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their sh t marriage  This is why you don't freeze time you guys It's incredibly irresponsible  Look there's no time to hold me accountable Morty Like literally no time Look around Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable Eventually everything either is or isn't And we've got about four hours to be “is”  We “isn't”  Alright since this time crystal exists in both possibilities and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time  Whatever you're asking the answer is I'm amazing And away we go  Huh what do you know it's working  Oh shit  What the hell is wrong with you two I—I m—I m—I mean you four  Good I'm glad it was painful You do deserve it I saw you you're both belch all over the damn place We've been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum f ing wind What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about Your brand of zit cream Which chair to sit in while I do everything Come on spit it out  Alright cool it I see what's happening here You're both young you're both unsure about your place in the universe you both wanna be “Grampa's favorite ” I can fix this Morty sit here Summer you sit here Now listen I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways but you have to understand that as far as Grampa's concerned you're both pieces of shit Yeah I can prove it mathematically Actually let me grab my whiteboard This has been a long time coming anyway  So in conclusion you're both equally mercurial overly sensitive clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi And I honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because I don't go by height or age I go by amount of pain in my ass which makes you both identical Alright everything resolved Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world  Alright perfect Sit still belch arms down I'm gonna do this again this time be like Grampa  And away we go  What's that You got something to say  And away we go  Huh that's weird Oh my God  That son of a bitch is gonna kill me  Follicle unfeeling sociopath Don't you get it He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them I have to admit it's always in the back of my mind too The difference is I would never do it Until now  Don't you get it don't you get it The other Rick isn't trying to merge us anymore He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them I have to admit it's always in the back of my mind too The difference is I would never do it Until now  Saving our lives After he takes me out he's gonna be coming for you  Me  You see that Get down  I told you he's a psycho  He's lost it The time fracture must have made him crazy  I don't know what to do I don't know what to do  Oh God now there's three of them we're outnumbered Get in the cupboards Wait don't don't do that they'll know wait wait think about getting in the cupboards but don't really AAAAH IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK FUCKS YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE  Shh shh I know where you are you creepy old monster I know how you think Oh is this where you think I'm going You think I'm standing here Well maybe you're right  Oh God my head What did you guys do  Only in self defense myself tried to kill me first Guys I don't expect you to understand this but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it Well actually I do expect you to understand that it's basic math C-could someone just let me out of here If I die in a cage I lose a bet  Ah for God's sake alright here give me the time crystal  Calling myself Here listen belch it'll probably go to voice mail since you know I'm calling myself  Hello Rick here  Don't fall for it it's a bit  Just kidding haha You just got Ricked You've reached Rick's voicemail you know what to do beep  Hey Rick it's Rick Listen I'm sorry about earlier No hard feelings I know you know I mean it too Take it easy Whoa Damn look at this I'm blown up Three new voicemails voicemail repeats Yeah yeah I heard this one voicemail repeats two more times You get the idea belch we're cool now  Fine I'll just do it myself  Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do Morty That's the difference between you and me I'm certain and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds  sigh  groan  Oh what you're just gonna listen to this guy now He's got a giant testicle for a head He came here in a bubble For all we know he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsack Land  We're not wearing collars  Alright fine Summer Morty put 'em on  Yes we're back problem solved  How long exactly do we have to wear these things They're really embarassing  I would have been happy to pay for it Summer but they don't exactly sell them at Costco Besides there's a larger lesson to be learned here Get him  What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you  Alright hear me out on this You're immortal right which means your life is infinite Well in that case there's 00% chance that you'll eventually do everything including turning around to look behind you  Ah God gross and weird  Summer Morty take off your collars  Good question I suppose the answer is: I'm not certain  I have no idea  I'm not sure  Time is falling apart we've got to get back to certainty quick Give me your collars  Morty I have to fix three of them and then there's thirty-one other versions of me that have to also fix three for a total of 96 I'm not an idiot I know how to be decisive now hand me that Phillips Flathead screwdriver Actually make it a Phillips Flathead  What's goin' on  What are you talking about it's not broken Morty I fixed it just put it on  Fine bring it here  Goddammit  Morty where's your collar I'll fix it  I'm okay with this Be good Morty Be better than me Bullsh t The other collar I'm not okay with this I am not okay with this Oh sweet Jesus please let me live Oh my God I—I've gotta fix this thing please God in Heaven please God oh Lord hear my prayers Yes Fuck you God Not today bitch  Yes I did it There is no God In your face One dot motherfuckers  You know what I'm talking about oh yeah I'm gonna do the cabbage patch Morty Check me out I'm doing the cabbage patch dance It's a classic dance remember like this Oh shit look at that  Yeah  Shut up Morty The last time you felt something we all almost died You little s—piece of shit  No it doesn't It hurts   No Morty no We have to help people   And alcohol Morty  Somebody get a memo to all the characters in those alien movies stat  Morty you don't drink drugs  offscreen Ho ho ho everybody  Calm down Jerry this is Ruben an old friend  I check in on him once a year and give him a little burp medical burp evaluation  Don’t worry about your C-C-Christmas Jerry leads Ruben away Ruben and I’ll be in my workshop while you have another day in Phil Collins’ proverbial paradise  Hi Joyce Leonard looks at Jacob Hello there  Morty A moment of your time  He’s in bad shape Morty  Gee thanks Morty What kind of monster do you think I am I-I’m sittin’ here trying to save the guy’s life Rick straps a pack with a tube onto Morty’s back and puts an earpiece on his head I want you to find Dr Xenon Bloom He’ll know what’s goin’ on  In Ruben shoves a glass oxygen mask onto Morty’s head  Ruben on the table Morty hooks up the backpack to the helmet Look I-I don’t have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything pulls a shrink ray into view and plugs it in Hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse  He’s busy  adjusts his own headset as he stands in the garage Depending on my aim you should be just south of the entrance  Welcome Morty The scene cuts back to Morty’s view from inside Ruben Welcome… …to Anatomy Park  It’s a little business venture I’ve been cookin’ up on the side with Dr Bloom An amusement park inside a human body Science isn’t cheap Morty This should really help put a dent in the overhead  You got a problem with that last one Morty  Okay alright if I sounded a little defensive it’s because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby  I-I got a lot of push-back when I pitched it Morty I guess I’m still a little defensive Let’s just find Dr Bloom alright I-I’m picking up a distress signal in the liver Morty  Proceed to the liver  Liver’s under maintenance Ruben’s seen some rough years Morty Don’t judge You don’t agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life’s going great  No no Morty The only monster here is alco— belch —holism That is an animatronic werewolf  Hey Bloom it’s Rick What the hell’s goin’ on here  Watch it  Just take a deep breath Ruben  Oh great work Morty pulls a massive syringe form his lab coat I’ll just cure it and then—  Okay Well I can’t cure death This is bad Morty You’re trapped in a dead man Listen if the situation keeps darkening do yourself a favor—  —and hop by Pirates of the Pancreas Obviously I’m biased but I think it’s great Morty  sitting in a lounge chair pulls out a flask It’s a bunch of pirates runnin’ around a-a-a- pancreas We don’t whitewash it either Morty The pirates are really rapey The top priority is to get you guys out of there but I’m just saying if that becomes impossible—  —please you gotta treat yourself  I’m trying to concentrate  holds up a hand without even looking over at him Not now Jerry I’ve got much much smaller fish to fry  Relative… That’s it Relative size Jerry hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite into his headset Morty Can you get to the left nipple  I’m almost there Morty  Where’s Dr Bloom  Goddamn it Morty I ask you to do one thing  Too bad about Dr Bloom Rick Annie and Morty exit the car He was a genius The only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park  What about Pirates of the Pancreas…  Booyah Hold your breath  Yeah so I heard You dodged a bullet Morty trust me whispers Puffy vagina  C’mon Let’s get some stuffing I’m starving  Oh unbelievable We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin’ around with their faces stuffed in computer screens Do you realize Christ was born today Jesus Christ our Savior was born today A-A-A-Are you people even human What kind of Christmas is this  Loud and clear Annie  Hey everybody  Yeah talk to me  Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit Ethan They’re inside you building a monument to compromise Fuck Fuck those people Fuck this whole thing Ethan  Yeah Morty  It's my favourite song  Oh yeah distress beacon Yeah baby  The first rule of space travel kids is always check out distress beacons; nine out of ten times its a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit  One out of ten times its a deadly trap but I'm ready to roll those dice  Yeah Cha-ching Oh yeah if you find a room full of eggs don't shy

you to be less powerful Never gonna happen tho right  Martin Luther King Jr 's birthday  It is  Oh there's no need to do that Beth Regular pancakes are fine  Oh I get it Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers Mmm I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me  Rick Sanchez of Earth dimension C- 37 You are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks by the authority of the transdimensional council of Ricks  Neutralise the Jerry  Everybody relax If I know these a-holes and I am these a-holes they just wanna haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions Let’s get it over with  Bring his mo- -orty  Leave my Morty out of this  You lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to join the council  Will you at least unfreeze my daughter’s idiot  The citadel of Ricks It’s the secret headquarters for the council of Ricks  As you know Morty I’ve got a lotta enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat Galactic terrorists a few sub-galactic dictators most of the entire intergalactic government: wh-wherever you find people with heads up their asses someone wants a piece of your grandpa And a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem So a few thousand versions of me had the INGENIOUS IDEA OF BANDING TOGETHER like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those people who answer questions on yahoo answers  Geez you’re easy to impress Yeah most timelines have a Rick and most Ricks have a Morty This place is a real who’s-who of who’s you and me  Turn your boring old Morty into a hot fashion statement with some Morty dazzlers  Hey check this out  Dumb  ‘Scuse me sir is your Morty insured You know every year hundreds of Mortys are injured in-  Back off Not my cup of tea this place  I say the point of being a Rick is being a Rick  Save your anti-Rick speech for the council of Ricks terror-Rick  Hey save your Rick rules for the sheep-Ricks Rick-pig  Fuck me pal  Fuck you No no no no no fuck me  Bring up the holograms  Twenty-seven Ricks brutally murdered in their own timelines An unprecedented Rick-icidal epidemic What say you Earth Rick C- 37  You think I did this Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe  You have a history of non-cooperation with the council  Yeah so does the scientist formerly known as Rick Wh-wh-wh-why isn’t he here in handcuffs  Because he’s dead too  No  Who else would you have us question You fit the profile Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve you’re the malcontent The rogue  I’m the Rick And so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance You wanted to be safe from the government so you became a stupid government That makes every Rick here less Rick than me  Can you believe this guy This guy needs to get out of here etc Ad lib  Yeah murmur it up d-bags Now if you’ll excuse me I’ve got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them They’re about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste And I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it but I think we all like fluffy discs of cake with syrup on top And I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there’s evidence So as they say in Canada peace oot  Evidence Good idea Scan his portal gun  Oh come on Don’t look at another man’s portal gun history We-we all go to weird places  Yes but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occured  What That’s Rick-diculous I’m obviously being set up  Earth Rick C- 37 The council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you know becomes impossible to grasp Also every ten seconds it stabs your balls  I’ve heard enough  Run Morty  That’ll keep ‘em busy for a while  ‘Course not Morty How could that profit me Someone out there is killing Ricks and the council ain’t gonna stop thinking it’s me until we clear our names  By finding the real Rick killer  Not really my style Morty Besides your home is most likely swarming with Ricks right now  Alright listen Jerry If Rick calls this device is going to trace his location You just gotta keep ‘em on the phone for thirty seconds or longer  Oh yeah Mmm Oh delicious  Beth you’re a treasure  I have a Beth just like you in my reality except you know what She’s not as brilliant or attractive  Ohohoho She did it She did it  Hey Jerry it’s Rick  So listen the heat’s on and there’s nowhere left to turn so Morty and I are just going to fly my spaceship into a black hole  Is that cool with you dog  I got it The call’s coming from… inside the house  Look at his face I can’t believe our daughter married you too easy etc Ad lib  The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry They won’t be able to help themselves But as soon as they get bored they’ll be on to us  Yeah more phonesticks please  Yeah it’s gotta be that way You’re a camouflage  Ricks have a very distinct and traceable brainwave due to our genius The best way to hide from an enemy’s radar is to stand near someone with complementary brainwaves that make ours invisible See wh-wh-when a Rick is with a Morty the genius waves get cancelled out by the uh Morty waves  Oh shit dog My portal gun was hacked remotely Morty obviously by the real killer to frame me But I was able to trace the signal Come on let’s go  Uh-oh  ‘Scuse me we’ve tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location They look exactly like us so in order to avoid confusion I’m going to mark us each with a red X right now That way if someone has a gun and we both tell you to shoot the other one because they’re the evil one you’ll know who’s lying  Hey check it out  Dammit  The red X Red X  Hey it’s a good thing that space outlet had labcoats and your favourite kind of shirt in stock huh Morty  Man this place is wayyy off the grid This guy does not wanna be found  Morty you’re making a bigger deal out of this than it is  Not people Morty Mortys  Well one Morty’s enough to hide from the bureaucrats But you g- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put ‘em in agonising pain That creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks motherfucker I fiddled with a concept like this once  On paper Morty on paper I wouldn’t do this it’s barbaric overkill I mean you could accomplish the same result with like five Mortys and a jumper cable Which I also wouldn’t do I’m just saying it’s bad craftsmanship  Hi Jerry  Oh you are Wh-wh-what do you do  Advertising Wow So people need help figuring out what to buy and then y-you help them  Well I mean you do it and you seem like a guy that really has it all together  Oh gosh wh- I hope not I-I-I-I wouldn’t want to offend you in any way  Ohoho Y-of course I am Just as much as my Morty’s a Morty  That’s right Jerry He-he’s from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz mask people He’s Eric Stoltz mask Morty They assigned him to me because… I never had any kids of my own But if I did boy I’d love ‘em if they were as smart and as successful as you are Jerry  Hey get a load of this Jerry’s hanging out with doofus Rick  Haha this is perfect  Oh is that the timeline where everybody eats poop Jerry you know this guy eats poop right  Hey I don’t eat poop Y-you guys are always so mean to me  I guess it’s only fair to tell you now Jerry… I’m the worst Rick of them all  Wow you really are wise Jerry I-I guess that’s why you work in advertising  Hey it’s your choice to take it personally Morty Now for the love of god be quiet The point of this is to get the drop on the guy  Yeah that’s right You are You’re a perfect impenetrable sheet of human armour Morty Because you’re as dumb as I am smart Which is why when I say ‘shut up’ it’s really good advice  Great nice work Morty  Ooh look at you C- 37 You’re- aren’t you a tough customer  The slow clap Really Kinda played out dude  Not in this dimension it isn’t In fact hah I invented it and nobody else has ever even done it here before  Well lah-dee-dah  Hey that’s mine  I don’t like the look of that Rick Morty We gotta escape  Don’t be Rickdiculous Morty  Take his Morty away  Yeah yeah looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here Zing  That guy got it  Ah-ah Rick quiet You’re missing my symphony  Hey I’ll take it over Mumford and Sons Zip  This guy is on it  He’s not laughing at your dumb jokes Rick That’s just a random noise it makes every ten seconds  See Rick you’re not as clever as you think you are I wanted you to find me We’re not so different you and I  Yeah duh  See this right here Rick I crunched the numbers I created a spectrum of all the Ricks I listed ‘em out from most evil to least evil Here’s where I am And look at right here’s where you are Rick This guy right here Super weird  I get it So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks right Is that where you’re going with this ‘Cause that’s where I’d be going  Please I think I’m doing pretty good on my own I’m simply going to download the contents of your brain and then kill you  Okay if we add a little more titanium nitrate and just a tad of chlorified tartrate: ovenless brownies  Well come on I can’t take all the credit Jerry It was your idea C’mere Jerry  You know Jerry I’m not gonna tell you that these will increase in value or even hold their current value The truth is… you bought ‘em ‘cause you like ‘em They have value to you That’s what matters  Until we find your Rick  You’ve lived quite a life Rick It’s a real shame you’re not gonna be around to see it through  You’re crying Over a Morty  No I’m just allergic to dipshits  Ugh pathetic We both know that if there’s any truth in the universe it’s that Ricks don’t care about Mortys  Do your worst you little bastards Kill me Do it Do it  Morty Get me out of this Come on  Point taken but this is no time for arcs  Yeah hello  Hey what do me and O J not have in common  Huh Wh-who is this  I found the real killer biitch Get over here  Yo ding-dong We’re done here Time to go  Well Jerry I guess this means goodbye  Jerry W-we both know it wouldn’t work It’s time to go back to our lives I love you Jerry I love ya  They’ll go back to their families attend school regularly play video games date girls… poor little Rickless bastards  Earth Rick C- 37 the council apologises for its false accusation And in the way of reparations for our terrible mistake we would like to compensate you with this voucher for a free replacement Morty in the event that Morty should-  Uh guys Not a good time Come on Morty let’s hit it  Alright Morty don’t break an arm jerking yourself off  Hey Morty you want connection Go be part of some stupid club like all those dumb Ricks You know maybe I don’t connect because I’m the Rickest Rick there is And you know it would go without saying that the Rickest Rick… would have the Mortyest Morty  Yeah it would Did you hear me say it  Just don’t get too big for your loafers Buster Brown A cocky Morty could lead to some big problems Could be a real bad thing for everybody  I-I-I’ll explain when you’re older  What a mess…  Pride cometh before the fall I guess he got what he deserved  What is that  Hand me the laser defibrillator  Hey guys Uh c-can I help  No Go clean the toilets Maybe you’ll make friends with some turds  You make us ashamed to be ourselves  My god I’ve seen this technology before This Rick was being controlled remotely puppeteered by somebody else This is the receiver  Yeah but where’s the transmitter  Wubbalubbadubdub Oh Hey Jerry Wh-wh-what are you doing in my room buddy  Alright Okay get out  What’s that dipshit doing out there Are you friends with him You know he eats his own shit right Oh my god this is rich I’ve got like ten Ricks to call right now  Oh boy Time to go Morty  The Pentagon I mean not THE Pentagon burp The lame one here on Earth  Morty and I are going to look into it You guys hold tight  Stay back This watch turns people into snakes  My name is Rick Sanchez This here’s my grandson Morty  I’ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we’ve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse So you can forget about nukes and you can forget about math This head won’t go away until burp Earth shows them it’s got a hit song  No Frasier A live performance of a newly-written catchy original song The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms  You’re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 5  Good luck Mr President  I dabble Mr President  Who’s NOT a musician Morty  Yeah not with that attitude  All right Morty let’s get ready to do it Why don’t you uh find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat  Morty Good music comes from people who are relaxed Just hit a button Morty Gimme a beat  Ahhhhh yeahhhhh  Take off your pants and your panties  Take a shit on the floor  Hey take your pants off  I think planet Earth has just been transported  Uhh it’s probably a bad time to mention it but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead  Geez Morty The guy’s just doing his job Take it easy  Genius happens in the moment Morty  That’s planning for failure Morty Even dumber than regular planning Balls  Morty Morty stop Listen There’s only so much charge left in this thing If we portal home from here and back we’re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world Get it  Yeah burp you see I try to shelter you from certain realities burp Morty Cause if I let you make me nervous then we can’t get schwifty  Hey Morty Could you lick my… Rick presses keys on the keyboard with the sample of him saying “Balls”  Wait wait wait Come on h-hold on a second  Whoa whoa Morty Give me that  Morty just put it down You don’t know what you’re doing  Nooooo  Ahhhh sh  Wh-What do you think Ice Probably a little over-developed  Well do you think maybe could you give me some help with it or…  Ice I don’t want to be a negative Nelly or anything but burp if Morty doesn’t come back with my

dump or something I  mean it's not a place for smart people Jerry And I know that's not a popular  opinion but it's my two cents on the issue  This was a good breakfast Beth You really made the crap out of those eggs I wish your mother was here to eat them  There you are Morty Listen to me I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension I need an extra pair of hands  It's pretty obvious Morty I froze him Now listen I need your help Morty I mean we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business It's important Come on Morty  Do you have any concept of how much

thing Rick  Not that you asked Morty but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore The stuff was all over the place Morty  There's just one problem Morty one little hang-up The dimension I visited was so advanced that they had also halted the aging process and everyone there was young Morty and they had been forever I was the only old person there Morty It was like I was some sort of you know celebrity walking around I-I was fascinating to them There were a lot of attractive women there Morty and they they they they all wanted time with me I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies but I spent so much time there my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left Morty It's

inside your butthole Morty  Put them way up inside there as far as they can fit  Well somebody's got to do it Morty Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum

no You you really wear the pants around here I just want you to know between us from now on it's gonna be clear communication  No idea what you're talking about  Full disclosure Morty it's not Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity  Yeah and once those seeds wear off you're gonna lose most of your motor skills and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours Morty  I'm sorry Morty It's a bummer In reality you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back so now we're gonna have to go get more  And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it Morty

toxins We're the toxins Are you listening you stupid little garbage person We're what got removed  Hey man listen Those comments I made about your throat  It's nice of you to let me off the hook It's still unacceptable behavior and I do regret it  What is that  That is an interesting concept You know it makes me wonder if there's an algorithmic expression that could achieve the ideal ratio Listen

us have their own identities their own will to live W-What if mine shares my intelligence and devised a way to reach out to us  I don't think I can just blow this off Morty If I had known it worked this way I wouldn't have detoxed Well I would have because I was toxic Now I'm detoxed and I'm accountable to my toxins right I-It's a dilemma I think I know what to do  Morty great news I went back to the spa and they let me purchase the containment unit from their detoxifier  Because we're coming home bitch  This is the parts of your pussy grandpa that keep it real Oh oh and I think you dropped

let me distract you  I want you and your sister to come home  You don't have to kick me while I'm down Morty Look there's no replacing either of you without an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose  I don't know if that applies to the throats of murder victims Morty  Well the longer you wait Morty the more it's gonna feel like committing a whole murder I think your arm just called it too early because it wasn't the arm of a paramedic Here  It's the least I can do I-I-I-I owe you this much See Morty Now we're both accountable  The reason I wanted this is because it can do this  This is a really special thing I mean you could use it to power all your vehicles You wouldn't be reliant on gasoline You'll be the most advanced tribe of radioactive cannibals in the whole --  -- this version of the world  You don't have to ask me twice Home is nuts right now My daughter's going through a divorce and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all  Ah Summer's home  Uh we

a man of science  Hahahahaha  Hey Morty lemme ask you a question real quick Does evil exist and if so can one detect and measure it  Rhetorical question Morty The answer is yes you just have to be a genius  Your sister’s boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded  Uh Morty I’m not disparaging the differently abled I’m stating the fact that if I had used this microscope it would have made me mentally retarded  Well that’s retarded  Apparently nothing  It’s not  Whoa  Stay scientific Jerry  This serum should counteract the negative effects  Here You can have this back  Sure I did To develop this It detects and catalogues all your Twilight Zone Ray Bradbury Friday the 3th of series voodoo crap magic I thought you might want it so you didn’t accidentally sell anybody say a typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries then makes the murders happen in real life Oooh  Don’t you want to make sure people know what they’re getting You’re not intentionally selling

or thrift store that grants you powers but fucks with you in unforeseeable ways Bring it to Curse Purge Plus I use science to uncurse the items for cash and you get to keep the powers This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster But guess what He would have had to run until he died making them worthless I removed the curse making them worth like I dunno eight million dollars See ya

because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain  Shoney's  Relaxed enough     Oh any particular ones You want to see my first boner or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel  ' Ooh your little flappy doodles are twitching Does that mean you're aroused or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape  Yeah well tough titties  Well that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty  The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her  Fine but I'm driving  To the day it all began and ended The moment that changed everything  Yeah I'd like to get a 0-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce Like as much as you're allowed to give me In 998 they had this promotion for the Disney film Mulan where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce and it's delicious And then they got rid of it and now it's gone This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it is in my memory  Okay All right all right  Me I used to wear blue pants  I didn't I did  Well well well If it isn't us You know the worst part about inventing teleportation Suddenly you're able to travel the whole galaxy and the first thing you learn is you're the last guy to invent teleportation Fortunately you're about to invent something much more powerful  Imagine doing anything you want then hopping to a timeline where you never did it Imagine going anywhere anytime with nobody able to stop you  Sounds lonely  Lonely Dude you have yourself -- your infinite selves It's a nonstop party where all the guests are the only person we like You think it's cool being the smartest man on Earth but once we give you this technology you become the smartest thing in every conceivable universe -- the Infinite Rick a god  Eh pass  Excuse me Bro Ricks don't pass on this Who do you think you are  A different kind of Rick I guess  Well we'll see how long that lasts  That Dianne is the last great idea that will ever be had in this garage  We detected a compromised portal gun Where is your Rick  Very troubling We can't risk Citadel secrets falling into the Federation's hands We'll dispatch SEAL Team Ricks immediately to break into the prison holding C- 37  Aand assassinate him  Come on girls The ice cream's gonna melt  Nooooooo  Carry the three add a two I got it I got it  Yeah That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost  Nope they cannot  Because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer  True but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story  Mission accomplished boys Pull me out  Okay have fun in what's left of my brain I'm gonna transfer to yours Oh there's not enough room for all my genius so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture my desire to play the trumpet my tentative plans to purchase a hat and six years of improv workshops Comedy comes in threes  Yeah SEAL Team Rick's in the house  Hi Rick Bye Rick  I'm bummed I didn't get to give that insect dick a test-drive  Wait wait wait wait T-The Council of Ricks sent us We have your Morty and Summer They're prisoners on the Citadel  Great   Lovely Not only is my plan screwed up I also forgot how to improvise   Not anymore homey SEAL Team Ricks turned his unibrow into two brows -- with a bullet Your Rick's dead Your Rick's dead  Sir Rick D-99 is returning from the mission alone Apparently SEAL Team Ricks suffered heavy casualties  Bring him in  He says he'll only talk to a Rick with higher clearance  La-di-da Give me that D-99 this is the commander in chief of the Citadel's militia  Go -- good enough  Operating an unregistered portal gun radicalizing a Summer conspiring with a traitorous Rick How do you plead  It's not fair you have no rights and he's not a lawyer We just keep him here because he's fun Look at him go  We'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick What say you Summer  Morty  Let's not suck the ghost of his too hard He was a terrorist and now he's dead  Wait wait wait wait No no no  The Citadel's been teleported to Federation space It's doomed This has to be C- 37 you guys What are we gonna do You know he's coming for us  All right calm down We have his Summer as a hostage Obviously I get her You guys play Rick Laser Scissors for the Morty  W-W-What the hell is that  Payback   Duh  Morty take this You're gonna need it later  That's enough Rick  What -- What's this supposed to accomplish We have infinite grandkids You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here  You're a rogue Rick -- irrational passionate You love your grandkids You came to rescue them  I came to kill you bro That's not even my original Summer  Why not shoot through her  20 yards nine-gauge plasma pistol My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you second shot adds recoil The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her which I'm encouraging you to do  Or let her go which I will reward with a quicker death  Because you love her  Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot which will be your least painful death But if you want to die slower than that I'm super into it All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl  Not an issue sweetie  Morty I know you're too stupid to get this but you're really this up right now  I wasn't gonna let her die you moron  The point is he thought I was going to  You're a serious idiot Morty You basically killed us all You're the worst You're as dumb as a bag of sand  That was amazing Morty Oh my God Wow Okay let's wrap this-  Good job Morty Let's go kids  Oldest Rick trick in the book  Not until I finish what I started And that is how you get level-nine access without a password  Employee of the month ladies and gentlemen  Destroying the galactic government  Good pitches kids I'm almost proud But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one to a zero  Guess who dismantled the government  I never will baby  Jerry is there any light beer left It's insane what you miss in prison  No you're right Where's the vodka  Seems like you guys need some privacy I'll uh -- I'll be in the garage  What the Not cool Jerry A man's garage is his castle  Oh I-I'm sorry to hear that sweetie I hope I had nothing to do with that  For everybody  Not so fast Morty You heard your mom We've got adventures to go on Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom but never your dad You want to know why Morty Because he crossed me  Oh it gets darker Morty Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures First thing that's different -- no more Dad Morty  He threatened to turn me in to the government so I made him and the government go away  I've rep laced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home -  - without you and your sister so now you know the real reason I rescued you Oh I just took over the family Morty and if you tell your mom -  - or sister I said any of this I'll deny it -  - and they'll take my side because I'm a hero Morty And now you're gonna have to go -  - and do whatever I say Morty forever And I'll -- I'll go out and I'll find some more of that Mulan Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce Morty -  - Because that's -- that's what this is all about Morty  That's my one-armed man I'm not driven by avenging my dead family Morty That was fake I-I-I'm driven by finding that McNugget sauce  I want that Mulan McNugget sauce Morty That's my series arc Morty  If it takes nine seasons I want my McNugget dipping sauce Szechuan sauce Morty  That's what's gonna take us all the way to the end Morty  Season -- Nine more seasons Morty Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce  For 97 more years Morty  I want that McNugget sauce Morty  Uh w-why don't you get it

egg-shaped item  Ughhhh places a napkin over the hologram and takes it to the bin in the kitchen  Uhhhh l-l-let's not get carried away Morty  No Weddings are basically funerals with cake If I wanted to watch someone throw their life away belch I'd hang out with Jerry all day  What do you know about friendship Jerrrrrry  Still eating cereal I assume Planet Squanch 6000 lightyears across the galaxy  Yeah I know Now we have to go to the wedding  Unscrewing and drinking from scotch flask Hey what's up Squanchy  Beth Squanchy culture is more contextual than literal You just say what's in your squanch and people understand  Well I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren Jerry But life is made of little concessions  Who the fuck are you  Everybody just relax for a second There's no such thing as an Uncle Steve That is an alien parasite  No you haven't Jerry These telepathic little bastards they embed themselves in memories they use those to multiply spread out and take over planets It's disgusting  He's a real piece of shit This is a big one someone probably tracked in last week on the bottom of their shoe or on a piece of alien fruit  Get off the high road Summer we all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet  No Steve put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house eat your food and multiply We could be infested with these things so we
